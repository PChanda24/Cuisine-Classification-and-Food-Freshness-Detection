# Cuisine Classification and Food Freshness Detection

## Overview
The objective of this project is to automate the process of food item classification and freshness detection using machine learning. This device helps in monitoring food items in a refrigerator, predicting their expiry dates, and setting reminders for users.

## Features
- **Cuisine Classification**: Utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to classify the cuisine of food items.
- **Food Freshness Detection**: Predicts the expiry date of food items and sets reminders for the user.
- **Web Application**: A user-friendly web interface to display food items and their expiry dates.
- **Automated Data Retrieval**: Automates the process of retrieving data from utility portals.
- **End-to-End Project Development**: From data collection and preprocessing to model training and deployment.
- **Data Quality Improvement**: Techniques to ensure high-quality data for reliable model predictions.

## Skills and Topics Covered
- **Machine Learning**: Building and training convolutional neural network (CNN) models.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Techniques for cleaning and preparing data for machine learning.
- **Python Programming**: Writing scripts and Jupyter notebooks.
- **Web Development**: Creating a web application interface using Flask (or any other framework you used).
- **Data Visualization**: Creating dashboards and visualizations for data analysis.

## Results
- Achieved a training accuracy of 79% and a validation accuracy of 60% in cuisine classification using the CNN model.
- Improved manual data collection efficiency by 65%.
